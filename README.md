# openAiDiscordBot

this is my small project to make openai talk to discord bots AKA integrate openai to discord servers

## commands so far

### ask

/ask accepts 3 params, with the input being required.
the other two are tokens and creativity
**input** string with what you want to ask the bot
**token** number between 1 and 4000
**creativity** float number between 0 an 1?

### create

/create accepts 3 params, the input is required
the other two tokens are amount and size
**input** string what you want the bot to create
**amount** number how many pictures you want to create (only one works for now)
**size** string of the size you want the images to be (example: "1024x1024")
